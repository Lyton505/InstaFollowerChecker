## Why

When my account was still set to a public account, a stream of bot and scamming accounts 
followed me so that they could send me links to malicious links since only my followers can 
send me messages. I noticed however that I never followed these accounts back; hence I can 
easily identify them by checking which accounts I do not follow back. **This program gives you 
a list of accounts that follow you but you don't follow them back**

## What you need

- two files that you would've downloaded from your account profile(go to Accounts center in 
  Settings -> Your info and permission -> Download info --- download as json)
  - unzip and look for the files: followers_1.json, and following.json
- python3
